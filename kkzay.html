    <h1>Thanks For Teaching Sir</h1>

    <div class="h">
      <p>
        Throughout the last year, I have learned a lot from the sir. The sir's
        patience, His kindness and desire to go above and beyond has motivated
        me to be a better student. His ability to explain complex concepts in an
        easy to understand way really motivated me to learn. I am grateful to
        the sir for teaching me while working. Your hard work and teaching has
        had a lasting effect on me, and I am very grateful to have had the
        opportunity to learn from someone as smart and enthusiastic as you. I
        will continue to study this knowledge.
